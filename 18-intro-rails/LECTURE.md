# Intro to Rails 🚂
## Goals 🏔
- [ ] Take whirlwind tour of Rails app generation 🌪
- [ ] Compare and contrast Sinatra and Rails ⚖️
- [ ] Review past, present, future of Rails 🗺
- [ ] Build out Rails app with model, controller, and view 🛠

## What is Rails? 🤔
### Making a Rails App 🌪
- ❓*What's an example of domain and a model in that domain?*
- Build it out!
  - Install `gem install rails`
  - `rails new DOMAINNAME`
  - **BAM! Look at all of this stuff!!**
  - ❓*What kind of model should we have?*
  - `rails g scaffold MODELNAME ATTRIBUTES`
    - (If you don't write `attribute:type` in full, default is string)
    - Builds out MVC
  - `rails db:migrate`
  - `rails server`
  - `localhost:3000`, `localhost:3000/MODELNAMEs`, `localhost:3000/MODELNAMEs/new`
  - We have a whole CRUD suite in place in 5 min!
  - ⁉️*Who's pissed?* 
- Why are we doing this to you?!
  - Rack and Sinatra gave us a ground-level view of a RESTful web application with MVC architecture
  - Learn Sinatra first, become better programmer
  - It's not all a waste...
### Compared to Sinatra ⚖️
- [Say goodbye to Sinatra (for now)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ML8PrP3A8E) 🎙
- Same: Both are Rack-based 🙂
- Same: Both follow MVC pattern 🙂
- Same: Migrations 🙂
- Same: Models 🙂
- Same-ish: `rails` vs. `rake` for migration & seed commands 😐
- Same-ish: `.html.erb` vs `.erb` view file extension 😐
- Different: Route (action) kept in 2 places 🙁
  - Sinatra: `books_controller.rb`
  - Rails: `app/controller/books_controller.rb` & `config/routes.rb`
- Different: Rails has more commands to generate file templates! 🙁
- Different: `rails server` instead of Sinatra's `shotgun` 🙁
- ❓*What else do you notice or wonder about?* 
### Reviewing the Generation ⚙️
- Reviewing the aftermath of `rails new`
  - Things should look familiar... see: `Rakefile`, `config.ru`
  - `git init from "."` automatically run for you
  - ❓*What do we mean by "convention over configuration"?*
  - `/app`, the "assets pipeline"
  - `/bin`, stuff that can be run with the command line
  - Rails sets up tests for you! "It's opinionated."
  - `bundle install` automatically runs for you
- Reviewing `rails g scaffold`  
  - Don't use!
    - Too many extra files
    - Not educational
  - ❓*Anyone know how to write CoffeeScript?*
## History of Rails 🗺
- ❓*What do y'all know about Rails?*
- ❓*How did you feel when you learned Flatiron taught Rails?*
- David Heinemeier Hanson builds frameworks, races cars, writes books
  - Created Rails in 2003 while working on code base for Basecamp
  - Rails 1.0 landed in 2005
  - Three principles
    - Ruby
    - MVC architecture
    - Programmer happiness
  - Two goals
    - Increase programmer happiness
    - Increase programmer productivity levels
  - "Convention over configuration"

## Rails Right Here, Right Now 🛠
### Review, con't ⚙️
- Review files and folders in editor
  - File structure is largely the same
-   We'll discover the structure and contents over the next week
- *What do we keep in the `/app` folder?*
### Getting Started with App and Model 🧰
- Scalpel vs. axe
- One more time with feeling...
  - `rails new DOMAINNAME` to make app frame
  - `rails g model MODELNAME ATTRIBUTES` to generate model
  - `rails --help` to see all commands
  - `rails g --help` to see generator options
    - `--no-test-framework` to remove extra testing files
    - 5 different generators!
      - `Migration`
      - `Model`
      - `Controller`
      - `Resource`
      - `Scaffold`
  - ❓*What is a model? What is its job?*
  - Generating entries in database
  - `rails console` to do it manually
  - Better yet, `seeds.rb` (and the Faker gem) to do it 
### Generating Routes and Controllers
  - ❓*What is a controller? A route?*
  - A route is a combination of the path requested and the HTTP verb used to request that path.
    - Sinatra manages routes and code executed for route in same palce
    - Rails separates routing and controller logic
  - Three ways to generate controllers
    - Manually create `.rb` file and write in it
    - `rails g controller CONTROLLER_NAME [ACTIONS]` to generate controller (notice plural case)
    - `scaffold_controller` generator
- `rails s` for `rails server` and `rails c` for `rails console`
  - To customize port: `rails s -p 9393`
- Quick bash aside
  - To kill port process
    - `lsof -i tcp:3000` to see what's running on port 3000
    - `kill -9 PID`
automatically
  - Routing issue
    - See for route list:
      - `localhost:3000/rails/info/routes`
      - `rails routes`
    - Where are our routes?
      - `config/routes/rb` is the route definition file
        - get `get '/dinosaurs', to: 'dinosaurs#index'` for specific route
        - `resources :dinosaur` for full CRUD route
      - Actions in controller
### Error messages 🚨
  - Browser console debugging is useful, but not as reliable as terminal
  - Controller issue
    - ❓*According to error message, where do we need to go?!*
  - Format issue
    - **Read error messages**
    - `render :index` optional in controller!
  - You can have multiple terminal windows open!
  - `rails routes`
  - This was just an introduction
### Views 👀
  - Almost the same story as Sinatra
    - `.html.erb` is Rails' erb file extension
    - Controller reference optional
  - Implicitly linked to controller
    - `render :bananas` explicitly renders `bananas.html.erb`
    - Controller reference optional
## Closing Remarks 🙏
  - Go slow to go fast
  - We'll flesh out the details over the next week
  - What is Rails teaching you about software engineering?
