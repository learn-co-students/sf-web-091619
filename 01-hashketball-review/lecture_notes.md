* Claps and snaps

 * Test-Driven Development
  - RSPEC syntax: reading errors
  - Using test code to drive lab progression
  - `rspec --fail-fast` handleÂ one error at a time
  - Red, Green, Refactor
  - Make it work (shameless green), make it right, make it fast
 * Debugging tools: binding.pry & puts
 * Best Practices in coding

 - Keep code DRY (DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF) principle: refactor code if redundant
 * Iterator methods: `#each`, `#map`, `#find` & `#select`
